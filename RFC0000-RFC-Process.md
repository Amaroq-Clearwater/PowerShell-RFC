# PowerShell Language RFC Process and Guidelines

A PowerShell Language RFC (Request for Comments) is a publication to propose 
design changes and improvements to the PowerShell script language.  This
provides the community an opportunity to provide feedback before code is
written where it becomes harder to change at the risk of compatibility. The
complete list of RFCs are available at
https://github.com/powershell/powershell-language-rfc

## Roles

Currently, only members of the PowerShell Core team are allowed to author
new RFCs.  All members of the community can provide feedback to any RFC.

## RFC Workflow

RFCs go through several stages:

* Draft

This is the initial draft of a RFC posted for comments and considered a
work-in-progress.

* Experimental

Comments have been reviewed and code is being written to provide an working
example of the proposed design change to get further feedback.

* Accepted

Feedback from the experimental implementation and RFC have been reviewed.
Engineering team will work towards final implementation in code to match
the RFC.

* Rejected

Based on community feedback, this RFC was decided to not proceed any further.

* Final

Design and implementation is considered complete.
